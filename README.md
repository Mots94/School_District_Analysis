# School_District_Analysis

## Using Python to analyze standardized test scores

## Overview
The analysis of school data is often crucial to determine the district's allocation of yearly school funds.  In this analysis, factors such as average math and reading scores and percentage of students passing math and reading were compared to school budget, school size, and school type. The purpose of this analysis was to provide the district school board with a multi-level report of district and individual school performance.  The school board would like to know more about the top and bottom performing schools to determine if adjustments need to be made to the yearly school budget.
