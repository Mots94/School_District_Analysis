# School_District_Analysis

## Using Python to analyze standardized test scores

## Overview
The analysis of school data is often crucial to determine the district's allocation of yearly school funds.  In this analysis, factors such as average math and reading scores and percentage of students passing math and reading were compared to school budget, school size, and school type. The purpose of this analysis was to provide the district school board with a multi-level report of district and individual school performance.  The school board would like to know more about the top and bottom performing schools to determine if adjustments need to be made to the yearly school budget.  After completing this report the school board, it was discovered that Thomas High School had altered test scores for 9th grade students.  As a result, all 9th grade test scores had to be dropped from this analysis, and all metrics were revised to reflect this change. 

## Results
* There are no changes to the the nubmer of total schools, total students, or total budget between the original district analysis and revised district analysis.  There is a change to the average math score for the district, but it is small.  The original average score was 79.0, and changed to 78.9 after revision.  There is a change in percent of students passing math, reading, and math and reading though.  That is displayed in the outputs below:
